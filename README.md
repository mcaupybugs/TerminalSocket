# TerminalSocket

- The intent with this project is to create a terminal socket application which has a python script `server.py` for creating a socket server and then another python script `client.py` to create a socket client to share the messages.

### V2

- The functionality will be increased by adding the support of sharing files through socket.

### V3

- The application will be created in a full fledged desktop application.
